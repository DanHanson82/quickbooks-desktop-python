inteum-quickbooks-sync
======================
forking the following project https://github.com/invisibleroads/inteum-quickbooks-sync
It appears to be abandoned for good reason.  I think most of the planet has moved from Quickbooks desktop except me unforunately.  Looking to utilize the qbcom and qbxml modules and this pip installable in case somebody else in the planet needs to do something similar.


Requirements
------------
- QuickBooks desktop application
- QuickBooks SDK
- `win32com <http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads>`_
